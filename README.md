# BodyFatPercentage

Robust Body Fat Percentage (BFP) estimation framework using deep learning with clothing-invariant body shape features.  
This repository provides the code, models, and examples for training and evaluating BFP estimation systems that remain robust under diverse clothing conditions.

## 🔍 Overview
Estimating Body Fat Percentage (BFP) from visual data is challenging due to clothing variations such as loose garments, thick jackets, or sportswear.  
Our framework leverages:
- **Clothing-invariant body embeddings**
- **Domain-adversarial training (GRL)**
- **Feature alignment loss**

to achieve robust estimation across apparel domains.
